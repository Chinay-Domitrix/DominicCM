### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm DominicCM, or DigitalDragon on most platforms. Website: digitaldragon.dev (down).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Aetheria Online, a minecraft RPG server! You can join our discord at https://discord.gg/5SScTm8
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Aetheria Online, mentioned above. You can apply in our discord!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can message me on discord, I'm `DigitalDragon#0001`. It is reccomended to join the Aetheria Online discord so you don't have to friend me as I deny most friend requests. Alternatively, you can email me at `me@digitaldragon.dev`, though I will be slower to respond.
